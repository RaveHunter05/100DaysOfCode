                    <h2>Before We Start the Tutorial</h2>
                    <p>We will build a small game during this tutorial.
                        You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not building games —
                        but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are
                        fundamental to building any React app, and mastering it will give you a
                        deep understanding of React.</p>
        
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Tip</p>
                        <p>This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing.
                            If you prefer learning concepts from the ground up, check out our
                            step-by-step guide. You might find this tutorial and the guide
                            complementary to each other.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The tutorial is divided into several sections:</p>
                    <li>Setup for the Tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.</li>
                    <li>Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.</li>
                    <li>Completing the Game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.</li>
                    <li>Adding Time Travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.</li>
                    <h3>What Are We Building?</h3>
                    <p>In this tutorial, we’ll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-
                        toe game with React.</p>
                    <p>You can see what we’ll be building here: Final Result. If the
                        code doesn’t make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with
                        the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to
                        help you understand React and its syntax.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game
                        before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features
                        that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the
                        right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of
                        all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and is
                        updated as the game progresses.</p>
                    <p>You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with
                        it. We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial.
                        Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building
                        the game.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                    <p>We’ll assume that you have some familiarity with HTML and
                        JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if
                        you’re coming from a different programming language. We’ll
                        also assume that you’re familiar with programming concepts
                        like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent,
                        classes.</p>
                    <p>If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading this
                        guide. Note that we’re also using some features from ES6 —
                        a recent version of JavaScript. In this tutorial, we’re using
                        arrow functions, classes, let, and const statements. You can
                        use the Babel REPL to check what ES6 code compiles to.</p>

                    <h2>Setup for the Tutorial</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are two ways to complete this tutorial: you can
                        either write the code in your browser, or you can set
                        up a local development environment on your computer.
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>Setup Option 1: Write Code in the Browser</h2>
                    <p>This is the quickest way to get started!</p>
                    <p>First, open this Starter Code in a new tab. The new
                        tab should display an empty tic-tac-toe game board
                        and React code. We will be editing the React code in
                        this tutorial.</p>
                    <p>You can now skip the second setup option, and
                        go to the Overview section to get an overview of React.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment</h2>
                    <p>This is completely optional and not required for this
                        tutorial!</p>
                    <h2>Optional: Instructions for following along
                        locally using your preferred text editor</h2>
                    <p>This setup requires more work but allows you to complete
                        the tutorial using an editor of your choice. Here are
                        the steps to follow:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.</li>
                        <li>Follow the installation instructions for Create React App
                            to make a new project.</li>
        
                        <div>
                            <p>npx create-react-app my-app</p>
                        </div>
                        <li>Delete all files in the src/ folder of the new project</li>
                        <blockquote>
                            <h2>Note:</h2>
                            <p>Don’t delete the entire src folder, just the original
                                source files inside it. We’ll replace the default
                                source files with examples for this project in the
                                next step.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <div>
                            <p>cd my-app</p>
                            <p>cd src</p>
                            <br>
                            <p># If you're using a Mac or Linux:</p>
                            <p>rm -f *</p>
                            <br>
                            <p># Or, if you're on Windows:</p>
                            <p>del *</p>
                            <br>
                            <p># Then, switch back to the project folder</p>
                            <p>cd ..</p>
                        </div>
                        <li>Add a file named index.css in the src/ folder with
                            this CSS code.</li>
                        <li>Add a file named index.js in the src/ folder with this JS
                            code.</li>
                        <li>Add these three lines to the top of index.js in the src/
                            folder:</li>
                        <div>
                            <p>import React from 'react';</p>
                            <p>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';</p>
                            <p>import './index.css';</p>
                        </div>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Now if you run npm start in the project folder and
                        open http://localhost:3000 in the browser, you should
                        see an empty tic-tac-toe field.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We recommend following these instructions to configure syntax 
                        highlighting for your editor.

                    <h3>What Is React?</h3>
                    <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript 
                        library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose 
                        complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called 
                        “components”.</p>
                    <p>React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start 
                        with React.Component subclasses:</p>

                </div>
                <div>
